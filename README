===================
User Tcp FileSystem
===================

--------------------------
Version 1.961 (2015-02-04)
--------------------------

User Tcp FileSystem consists of (FUSE) client and (plain) server component,
each running on separate computers (usually, that is) and are connected to
each other via TCP connection. When connected, the clients provides
mountpoint where server provides file content.

Until utfs(1) -- sshlessfs(1) style cli frontend has been created, the
client and server component has to be started "manually" on the computers.
Either one can bind(1) TCP socket where the other one connect(1)s. After
connection is made there is simple handshake to identify connection before
system goes to serve files.

Executing ``make`` will provide information how to compile the client and
server components (on unix-like computers). Additionally a Windows (32bit)
version of the utfs-server can be compined (IIRC using mingw) -- to provide
files from windows machine to mountpoint on unix-like systems!

The ``./utfs-client`` and ``./utfs-server`` components, after compiled,
give brief usage information; this (test) example enlightens those a bit:

  hostA $ mkdir z
  hostA $ ./utfs-client -l bar -r foo -b :9999  z

  hostB $ ./utfs-server -l foo -r bar -c hostA:9999 .

When connection is made (when no firewall blocking!) hostA outputs
'utfs client is ready' and hostB 'utfs server is ready' utfs-server
(in hostB) does not detach by default, utfs-client (in hostA) does
detach. Now:

   hostA $ df z
   Filesystem     1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
   utfs-client    114769480 56616500  52299952  52% /path/to/z

and finally

   hostA $ fusermount -u z

releases the mount (utfs-server exits on hostB). Also breaking utfs-server
will do the umount.

Hint: initial test can be done on the same host using ``127.1`` as hostB
address.
